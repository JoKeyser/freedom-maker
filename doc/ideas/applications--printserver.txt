Idea

If the user chooses the "print server" option for their freedombox install,
we add a "print admin" panel in Plynth. You could always print and scan from
the web interface on the freedombox. No cloud needed. A printer-admin webapp
in your home.


Motivation

Apart from the ideological reasons to own a freedombox, we could have strictly 
"feature" based incentives for people to install freedomboxes in their homes.
We can think up at least a dozen of good applications for a home server that will 
drive adoption--I am sure. (file server, picture sharing app, music streaming
server, mail server)


Why printing?

A printing component--as I imagine it--would have the following properties:
    - Be able to automatically find and configure (CUPS scripts?) any printer
      on the network, or if it is attached as USB.
    - Print documents (.pdf,.docx,.jpgs,et al) uploaded to it.
    - Scan documents (web app for contolling scanner because scanning is broken!!)
    - Store documents (new scans or things in the print queue)
    - Script all of the above
