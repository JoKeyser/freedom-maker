Freedom-Maker  -  Bdale's building tools for the FreedomBox project

To build for a DreamPlug, use

	sudo ./mk_dreamplug_rootfs

This will yield a file tree under build/dreamplug, representing the
contents of a root file system.  Get that onto a USB stick with something
like

	sudo mount /dev/sdc1 /media/freedom
	sudo rsync -atvz --progress build/dreamplug/ /media/freedom/
	sudo umount /media/freedom

Move the USB stick to the DreamPlug, and arrange to boot the existing kernel
from internal microSD pointing to our new root filesystem by interrupting the
boot to talk to U-Boot:

	setenv bootargs_root root=/dev/sdc1
	saveenv

Press reset, and the system should boot.  On the first boot, an automated
script will run that configures all the packages, touched up a few config
files, and then forces a reboot.  Starting on the second boot, a login prompt
should eventually appear on the serial console.
