* before we tag 0.2

  - vmdebootstrap .img has FAT partition type code u-boot doesn't grok
  - copy2dream needs to fix up the UUID entries in /etc/fstab
  - update README to document booting from full-sized SD card

* Next Prerelease

- [ ] initial boot configuration improvements, as there are a few
      things we really do want to defer to first boot, or at least make
      it trivial to fix up per-system

	- [X] ssh host keys
	- [ ] root password
- [ ] add Sheeva as a build target
- [X] add x86 virtualized as a build target (use vmdebootstrap?)
- [ ] investigate and integrate software components that looks interesting
	- channel-server, the buddycloud channels service for XMPP
	- babeld, loop-free distance-vector routing protocol
	- tahoe-lafs, secure distributed filesystem
- [X] virtualbox should build with dreamplug configuration
- [X] mk_virtualbox_image and mk_dreamplug_rootfs should both reuse
      the same environment variables.
- [X] abstract the kernel version from source/install.sh
- [ ] DreamPlug should signal when it's finished booting.  Audio with
      Festival?  Visual with blinkenlights?  Either way, we could make a
      /etc/rc2.d/99-signal-running script.

* Stuff to do for First Feature Release

  - [X] pre-configured user interface
	- [X] DHCP and HTTP servers on eth0 and/or eth1
	- [X] plinth-based initial config interface

  - [ ] freedom buddy installed
  - [ ] openvpn server setup
  - [ ] the privoxy fork configured as a transparent proxy
  - [ ] plinth configured to at display these config details and to
        control whatever is feasible
