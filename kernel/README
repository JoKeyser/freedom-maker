This packages should get a kernel up and running into DreamPlug device.

WARNING: Packages are currently untested.

After kernel is installed on device, hooks should be calling:
 1) update-initramfs -c -k 3.0.0-4
 2) flash-kernel 3.0.0-4

After that you should get a uImage and uInitrd files under /boot.

This is work in progress, so stay tunned. Final goal is to enable
DreamPlug device in Debian, but currently it needs to get into mainline
Linus' kernel tree.

Bootloader
GlobalScale (or Marvell) code is reusing GuruPlug machine identification,
while mainline kernel assigns another machine identification for DreamPlug
3550. That might cause problems regarding the bootloader in use, if it is 
the mainline one or the GlobalScale provided one, which expect different
machine ID.

Linus' kernel
Jason Cooper is enabling device tree support, in the meanwhile,
Arnaud Patard is working out a patch to reuse GuruPlug machine definition.

After this work is completed upstream, enabling Debian support is trivial,
as enabling kirkwood kernel, debian-installer and U-Boot.

Nitpicks
Libertas UAP driver is hard to get into mainline kernel, so either someone needs
to attempt mainlining it or it needs to be built as separated module out of kernel
tree.
